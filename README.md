# PV-Module-Reliabilty
This paper explains the fusion of the physics-based material degradation mechanism with the statistics-based data modeling approach for predicting the degradation rate of photovoltaic (PV) modules. The degradation of PV module is mainly associated with the module construction type and climatic condition at its use location. The aim of this paper is to quantify the effect of dynamic environmental stresses (dynamic covariates) on the power degradation of the module over its lifetime. There are various physics-based models, such as Arrhenius model, for understanding the physical or chemical reaction-related root causes of PV degradation.
